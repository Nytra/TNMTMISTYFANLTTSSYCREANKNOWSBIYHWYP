# Welcome to the Neos mod that makes it so that your fingers are no longer trusted touch sources so you can rest easy at night knowing no one will shove buttons into your hand without your permission  
  
Or TNMTMISTYFANLTTSSYCREANKNOWSBIYHWYP for short.
  
If the mod name isn't self-explanatory, here's a quick rundown:  
Neos distinguishes between safe and unsafe TouchSources for security reasons.  
A TouchSource is anything that can press buttons on your behalf. That includes your fingers as they are what's called a "TipTouchSource".  
Now, by default, Neos regards the TipTouchSources you may have on your avatar as safe, meaning they are able to press any old type of button.  
That comes with the side-effect that people can make you press a button by just jamming it into your hand.  
This mod prevents that by forcing any TipTouchSource to be untrusted.
